            <h1 id="topic_name">Scaling of VaR: Assumptions</h1>
        <p>
            It is often the practice to convert the 1-period <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk" target="_blank" style="padding-right: 1px;">value at risk</a>(VaR) 
            into an equivalent VaR estimate for a period with a different length T, by scaling the 1-period VaR by the  square root of T.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the 1-period VaR may be regarded as some \( q\)<sup>th.</sup> quantile of the return distribution, let us denote it by \(V_{1}^{q}\). 
            The scaling of 1-period VaR to estimate the equivalent n-period VaR \(V_{n}^{q}\) can thus be written as

            $$V_{n}^{q} = \sqrt{n}V_{1}^{q}$$
        </p>
        <p>
            We shall discuss here, in some detail, the assumptions underlying the validity of the above transformation. 
            This shall allow us to also identify the conditions under which this simple scaling of the 1-period VaR may cease to remain valid.

            Assumption 0: The returns are specified by the log returns.
           </h3>
        <p>
            The n-period log return \(r_{n}\) is equal to the sum of n 1-period log returns \(r_{1}\)(s).
            $$r_{n} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}r_{1,i}$$

            Assumption 1: The 1-period log returns are independent and identically distributed.
           </h3>
        <p>
            If the 1-period log returns are distributed as
            $$r_{1} \sim \mathcal{D}_{r_{1}}(\mu, \sigma^{2})$$
            where \(\mathcal{D}_{r_{1}}(\mu, \sigma^{2})\) denotes any arbitrary distribution with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^{2}\).
            The n-period log return would then be distributed as 
            $$r_{n} \sim \mathcal{D}_{r_{n}}(n\mu, n\sigma^{2})$$
            where \(\mathcal{D}_{r_{n}}\) is in general of a different type than \(\mathcal{D}_{r_{1}}\).
            <br>
            Infact the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem" target="_blank" style="padding-right: 1px;">central limit theorem</a> states that
            $$\lim_{n\to \infty}\mathcal{D}_{r_{n}} \to \mathcal{N}(n\mu,n\sigma^{2})$$

            Mathematical formulation of VaR
        </h3>
        <p>
            The 1-period VaR \(V_{1}^{q}\) may be defined from
            $$\int_{-\infty}^{V_{1}^{q}}{\mathcal{D}_{r_{1}}(r_{1};\mu, \sigma^{2})}dr_{1}=q$$

            Under a change of variable \(y=\sqrt{n}r_{1}\), the above equation may be re-expressed as 
            $$\int_{-\infty}^{\sqrt{n}V_{1}^{q}}{\mathcal{D}_{r_{1}}(y/\sqrt{n};\mu, \sigma^{2})}(1/\sqrt{n})dy=q$$

            However from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function" target="_blank" style="padding-right: 1px;">transformation of probability densities</a>, 
            it can be shown that
            $$y=\sqrt{n}r_{1} \sim \mathcal{D}_{y}(\sqrt{n}\mu, n\sigma^{2})=(1/\sqrt{n})\mathcal{D}_{r_{1}}(y/\sqrt{n};\mu, \sigma^{2})$$

            Thus, using the above three equations we can equate
            $$\int_{-\infty}^{V_{1}^{q}}{\mathcal{D}_{r_{1}}(r_{1};\mu, \sigma^{2})}dr_{1}=\int_{-\infty}^{\sqrt{n}V_{1}^{q}}{\mathcal{D}_{y}(y;\sqrt{n}\mu, n\sigma^{2})}dy = q$$

            Hence, the equivalent VaR for \(y=\sqrt{n}r_{1}\) can be obtained as 
            $$V_{y}^{q}=\sqrt{n}V_{1}^{q}$$
        </p>
           <h3 id="section">
            Assumption 2: The log returns are normally distributed with mean 0.
           </h3>
        <p>
            Following the above formulation, the equivalent VaR \(V_{n}^{q}\) for the n-period return can be defined from
            $$\int_{-\infty}^{V_{n}^{q}}{\mathcal{D}_{r_{n}}(r_{n};n\mu, n\sigma^{2})}dr_{n}=q$$

           In general however, \(\mathcal{D}_{r_{n}}\) is of a different type than \(\mathcal{D}_{y}\) and we cannot leverage the results of the preceding section to determine \(V_{n}^{q}\).
           <br>
           If the 1-period log returns are normally distributed i.e.
           $$r_{1} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^{2})$$
           
           we can state that \(r_{n}\) and \(y\) both also follow a normal distribution, albeit with different means
           $$r_{n} \sim \mathcal{N}(n\mu, n\sigma^{2})$$
           $$y=\sqrt{n}r_{1} \sim \mathcal{N}(\sqrt{n}\mu, n\sigma^{2})$$

           Only if the 1-period log returns are normally distributed with mean 0, the distribution of \(r_{n}\) and \(y\) can be regarded as identical
           $$\mathcal{N}(r_{n};n\mu = 0, n\sigma^{2}) = \mathcal{N}(y;\sqrt{n}\mu = 0, n\sigma^{2})$$
           and the n-period VaR \(V_{n}^{q}\) obtained exactly as 
           $$V_{n}^{q}=\sqrt{n}V_{1}^{q}$$
        
        <h3 id="section">
            Approximate scenarios:
        </h3>

        <p>
            Under real world scenarios, where the above assumptions of the 1-period log returns being i.i.d. and sampled from a normal distribution with mean 0 may only be approximately valid i.e.
            $$r_{1} \sim^{i.i.d} \mathcal{N}(\mu \simeq 0, \sigma^{2})$$
            the n-period VaR may be roughly estimated by the scaling
            $$V_{n}^{q}\simeq \sqrt{n}V_{1}^{q}$$
