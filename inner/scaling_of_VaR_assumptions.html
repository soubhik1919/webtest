        <p>
            It is often the practice to convert the 1-period value at risk (VaR) into an equivalent VaR estimate for a period with a different length T, 
            by scaling the 1-period VaR with the  square root of T.
        </p>
        <p>
            We shall discuss here the assumptions underlying the validity of the above transformation. 
            This shall allow us to also identify the conditions under which the scaling of the 1-period VaR may cease to remain valid.
